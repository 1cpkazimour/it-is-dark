## What is this?
A game created by three underaged persons for an educational reason involving an educational institution and an Advanced Placement Computer Science course.

## Why?
Who asked? Also so we can pass this class.

## What?
This one confuses us as well

## So, how do I partake?
If you would only like to run our program, you just need to install the jdk so you can run our jar file. To install the jdk, follow the instructions at [this link](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/software2-openJDK/openjdk.html). Once you have installed the jdk, go to the releases tab on the main page of the GitHub repo (to the right of the list of files) and download the latest release by clicking on the release with the "latest" badge and then clicking the file with the name it.is.dark.jar. Once the file downloads, just double click it wherever it is and it will launch the game.

If you would like to make modifications, you also need to install a program called jGrasp. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/software2-openJDK/bundled.html). Once installed, go to the releases tab on the main page of the GitHub repository (to the right of the list of files) and download the latest version of the code by clicking the on the release with the "latest" badge and then clicking on the file named "Source code (zip)". Once the file is downloaded, unzip the folder by right clicking and clicking "extract" on windows or by double clicking on mac. Once unzipped, launch jGrasp. If you do not have other code editors on your computer, you most likely will be able to just double click each .java file to edit it in jGrasp. If you have other editors installed and clicking opens another program, then just drag and drop the .java file you want to edit or view into the jGrasp window and it will open. To run the program from jGrasp, open Main.java and click the red icon of the running person to compile (save) and run the code.

We hope you enjoy!
