# it-is-dark

## What is this?
A game created by three high school kids for their Computer Science course. The concept of the game is simple. The game is a normal platformer where the player has to make it to a location in the level, but the level is pitch black. The player reveals the level slowly by colliding with the surfaces in the level and "painting" or illuminating them.

## Why?
We needed a project to do in our CS class and though a game would be interesting.

## So, how do I partake?
If you would only like to run our program, you just need to install the jdk so you can run our jar file. To install the jdk, follow the instructions at [this link](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/software2-openJDK/openjdk.html). 

Once you have installed the jdk, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/1cpkazimour/it-is-dark/releases) and download the latest release by clicking on the release at the top of the list and then clicking the file with the name it.is.dark.jar. Once the file downloads, just double click it wherever it is and it will launch the game.

Playing the game is simple. Just click the spacebar to start the game and dive in. Move and jump with the arrow keys, WASD, or the spacebar. The game randomly cycles through levels. To give up and get a new level, simply press G on your keyboard.

If you would like to make modifications, you also need to install a program called jGrasp. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/software2-openJDK/bundled.html). 

Once installed, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/1cpkazimour/it-is-dark/releases) and download the latest version of the code by clicking on the release at the to and then clicking the file named "Source code (zip)". Once the file is downloaded, unzip the folder by right clicking and clicking "extract" on windows or by double clicking on mac. Once unzipped, launch jGrasp. If you do not have other code editors on your computer, you most likely will be able to just double click each .java file to edit it in jGrasp. If you have other editors installed and clicking opens another program, then just drag and drop the .java file you want to edit or view into the jGrasp window and it will open. To run the program from jGrasp, open Main.java and click the red icon of the running person to compile (save) and run the code. If you would like to make some levels of your own, change the value of the static boolean editMode in class Main to true to open the level editor.

## Some other info
This game uses Swing for graphics as well as keyboard and mouse input (mouse input is only used in level editor)
We hope you enjoy!
